### Overview

`Pugo` is a static website generator in [Go](http://golang.org). It builds `markdown` contents to static html files fast and simply. It can use to build blog, doc, and etc.

### Cross-platform

Thanks to Go, `Pugo` can run in linux, windows and MacOSX. I tested it in windows/amd64, linux/amd64 and darwin/amd64.
